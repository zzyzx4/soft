Description: Dojango is a reusable django application that helps you to use the client-side
        framework dojo within your django project. It provides capabilites to easily 
        switch between several dojo versions and sources (e.g. aol, google, local) and 
        delivers helping utilities, that makes the development of rich internet 
        applications in combination with dojo more comfortable. Also it makes the building 
        of your own packed dojo release easier. Another goal of this project is, that you 
        can learn how you have to structure your html to use dojo within your projects.
